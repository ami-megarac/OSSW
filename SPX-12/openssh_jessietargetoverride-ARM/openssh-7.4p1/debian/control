Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client for legacy SSH1 protocol
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of

 group.

 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication

 .
 This package provides the ssh1 and scp1 clients and the ssh-keygen1
 utility, all built with support for the legacy SSH1 protocol. This
 protocol is obsolete and should not normally be used, but in some cases
 there may be no alternative way to connect to outdated servers.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.

 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are

Description: secure shell (SSH) sftp server module, for SFTP access from remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the SFTP server module for the SSH server. It
 is needed if you want to access your SSH server with SFTP. The SFTP
 server module also works with other SSH daemons like dropbear.
 .
 OpenSSH's sftp and sftp-server implement revision 3 of the SSH filexfer
 protocol described in:
 .
  http://www.openssh.com/txt/draft-ietf-secsh-filexfer-02.txt
 .
 Newer versions of the draft will not be supported, though some features
 are individually implemented as extensions.

Description: secure shell client and server (metapackage)
 This metapackage is a convenient way to install both the OpenSSH client
 and the OpenSSH server. It provides nothing in and of itself, so you
 may remove it if nothing depends on it.

Description: secure shell client and server (transitional package)
 This is a transitional package depending on the regular Debian OpenSSH
 client and server, which now support GSSAPI natively. It will add the
 necessary GSSAPI options to the server configuration file. You can
 remove it once the upgrade is complete and nothing depends on it.

Provides: ssh-askpass,
Description: interactive X program to prompt users for a passphrase for ssh-add
 This has been split out of the main openssh-client package so that
 openssh-client does not need to depend on GTK+.
 .
 You probably want the ssh-askpass package instead, but this is
 provided to add to your choice and/or confusion.

Description: secure shell client for the Debian installer
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working

Description: secure shell server for the Debian installer
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 This package provides the sshd server for use in debian-installer.
 Since it is expected to be used in specialized situations (e.g. S/390
 installs with no console), it does not provide any configuration.
