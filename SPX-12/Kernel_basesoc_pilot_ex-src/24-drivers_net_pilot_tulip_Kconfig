+	help
+	  This selects the "Tulip" driver support for ServerEngines PilotIII.
+
+config TULIP_NAPI
+	bool "Use NAPI RX polling "
+	depends on PILOT_NET_TULIP
+	help
+	  NAPI is a new driver API designed to reduce CPU and interrupt load
+	  when the driver is receiving lots of packets from the card. It is
+	  still somewhat experimental and thus not yet enabled by default.
+
+	  If your estimated Rx load is 10kpps or more, or if the card will be
+	  deployed on potentially unfriendly networks (e.g. in a firewall),
+	  then say Y here.
+
+	  See <file:Documentation/networking/NAPI_HOWTO.txt> for more
+	  information.
+
+	  If in doubt, say N.
+
+config TULIP_NAPI_HW_MITIGATION
+	bool "Use Interrupt Mitigation "
+	depends on TULIP_NAPI
+	---help---
+	  Use HW to reduce RX interrupts. Not strictly necessary since NAPI
+	  reduces RX interrupts by itself. Interrupt mitigation reduces RX
+	  interrupts even at low levels of traffic at the cost of a small
+	  latency.
+
+	  If in doubt, say Y.
+
+config PILOT_SG

+config PILOT_AUTO_PHY

+	depends on PILOT_NET_TULIP
+	default n
+	help 
+	   Pilot3 has only one set of MDIO signal for both interfaces.
+	   So Both interfaces will detect two PHY devices where one PHY 
+	   belong to itself and the other belong to the other interfaces
+           If you enable this, the lower PHYID will be used for mac0 and 
+	   higher belong to mac1.(Aviator/Hornet cards follow this) 		 	   
+	   Select "y" only if the above logic is true. If you are not sure
+	   or one of the interfaces does not have a PHY (Uses NC-SI or UMP)
+	   select "n". You will be prompted to provide the PHY ID of each interfaces
