Description: Embedded GNU C Library: National Language (locale) data [support]
 Machine-readable data files, shared objects and programs used by the
 C library for localization (l10n) and internationalization (i18n) support.
 .
 This package contains the libc.mo i18n files, plus tools to generate
 locale definitions from source files (included in this package). It
 allows you to customize which definitions actually get
 generated. This is a space-saver over how this package used to be,
 with all locales generated by default. This created a package that
 unpacked to an excess of 30 megs.

Provides: locales
Description: Embedded GNU C Library: Precompiled locale data
 This package contains the precompiled locale data for all supported locales.
 A better alternative is to install the locales package and only select
 desired locales, but it can be useful on a low-memory machine because some
 locale files take a lot of memory to be compiled.

Description: Embedded GNU C Library: Name Service Cache Daemon
 A daemon which handles passwd, group and host lookups
 for running programs and caches the results for the next
 query. You should install this package only if you use
 slow services like LDAP, NIS or NIS+.

Description: Transitional package to ensure multiarch compatibility
 This is a transitional package used to ensure multiarch support is present
 in ld.so before unpacking libraries to the multiarch directories.  It can
 be removed once nothing on the system depends on it.
