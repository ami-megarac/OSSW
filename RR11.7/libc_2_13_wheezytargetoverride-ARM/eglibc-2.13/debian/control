Description: Embedded GNU C Library: National Language (locale) data [support]
 Machine-readable data files, shared objects and programs used by the
 C library for localization (l10n) and internationalization (i18n) support.
 .
 This package contains the libc.mo i18n files, plus tools to generate
 locale definitions from source files (included in this package). It
 allows you to customize which definitions actually get
 generated. This is a space-saver over how this package used to be,
 with all locales generated by default. This created a package that
 unpacked to an excess of 30 megs.

Description: Embedded GNU C Library: Precompiled locale data
 This package contains the precompiled locale data for all supported locales.
 A better alternative is to install the locales package and only select
 desired locales, but it can be useful on a low-memory machine because some
 locale files take a lot of memory to be compiled.

 standard libc shared library. The reduced library is used by debian-installer
 and may be useful for custom installation media and in embedded systems.
