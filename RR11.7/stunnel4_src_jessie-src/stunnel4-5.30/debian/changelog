stunnel4 (3:5.28-1) unstable; urgency=high

  * New upstream release:
    - high urgency: fix a bug introduced in 3:5.27-1: if an OpenSSL
      engine is used, the SSL library's initialization would not be
      performed completely, skipping, for instance, the proper
      initialization of the pseudo-random number generator
    - refresh the patches

  * New upstream version:
    - drop the 14-lsb-init-functions, 18-lsb-startup, and 20-comparison
      patches, applied upstream
    - rework the 02-rename-binary and 10-no-zlib-compression patches

      upstream, but a couple of new typos were introduced
    - refresh patches
    - add the 21-author-tests patch to make the building of the Win32
      binaries conditional on an environment variable and not on
      the presence of the .git directory
    - update the upstream copyright notice in debian/copyright
  * Drop the perl-modules dependency - "perl", brought in by perl:Depends,
    ought to be enough.

      catch up with upstream updates
    - refresh patches
    - drop the 05-logrotate-warning-in-sample-conf patch, applied upstream
    - drop the 15-upstream-systemd-libs, 16-upstream-sslv23-method, and

    it will most probably not be used at all later.
  * Fix the DEP-3 format of the 01-fix-paths, 02-rename-binary, and

    - refresh the 02-rename-binary, 10-no-zlib-compression, and
      12-restore-pidfile-default patches
    - drop the 09-init-script-ulimits patch, it was actually
      included upstream in 5.02
    - add the 13-init-script-typo patch to remove a stray quote
  * Add the 14-lsb-init-functions patch to source /lib/lsb/init-functions,

    - augment the 01-fix-paths patch to also move the pidfile to
      /var/run/ and not /usr/var/run/.

 -- Peter Pentchev <roam@ringlet.net>  Tue, 10 Jun 2014 17:23:32 +0300

stunnel4 (3:5.01-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add the 12-restore-pidfile-default patch to restore stunnel's
    "create the pid file by default" behavior, since the init script
    has no way of monitoring the started stunnel4 processes otherwise.
    The init script now warns about configurations with no "pid"
    setting; in a future version it will refuse to start stunnel for
    these configurations.  Closes: #744851

 -- Peter Pentchev <roam@ringlet.net>  Fri, 18 Apr 2014 14:37:42 +0300

stunnel4 (3:5.01-2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add the 11-no-rle-compression patch to disable RLE compression since
    OpenSSL does not really implement it.  Closes: #744350
  * Modify the 10-no-zlib-compression patch to not even allow starting
    a tunnel configured with "zlib" or "deflate" compression.

 -- Peter Pentchev <roam@ringlet.net>  Mon, 14 Apr 2014 15:24:25 +0300

    Closes: #727511
  * Canonicalize the Vcs-Git and Vcs-Browser source control fields.
  * Update the watch file a bit:
    - watch a mirror in addition to the main site, at least temporarily
      until the main FTP site is fixed
    - watch for 5.x versions, too
    - add Michal Trojnara's PGP key
  * Convert the copyright file to the 1.0 format and add my notice.
  * Remove the README.source file, unnecessary in the 3.0 (quilt) format.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.5 with no further changes.
  * Bump the debhelper compatibility level to 9 with multiarch:
    - let debhelper set the build environment variables

    - remove the libtool .la file in the multiarch lib directory
  * Drop the versions from the libssl-dev and openssl build dependencies.
  * Drop two automatically-created directories from debian/dirs
  * New upstream release:
    - Closes: #723781 (package new upstream version)
    - a fix for CVE-2014-0016 was included.  Closes: #740802

  * Add the init_script_status patch to support the 'status' command.
    Closes: #548974
  * Rename the Debian patches following a number sequence.
  * Modify the debian/stunnel3.8 and add the 08-client-example patch
    to add a client configuration example to the English manual page.
    Closes: #644398, although this one shall have to be referred to
    upstream for inclusion in the rest of the documentation, too.
  * Reword the note about FIPS support in README.Debian, fix a typo
    and correct the URLs to the OpenSSL FIPS User Guide.
    Closes: #642440
  * Optionally set resource limits on startup.  Closes: #599138
    - add the RLIMITS variable to /etc/default/stunnel4
    - add the 09-init-script-ulimits patch to honor it
  * Add the 10-no-zlib-compression patch to disable the hardcoded
    addition of zlib as a compression algorithm for OpenSSL 0.9.8 and
    later; the Debian OpenSSL package is compiled without support for
    zlib compression since version 1.0.1e-5.

stunnel4 (3:4.53-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream version 4.53.
    - Added client-mode "sni" option to directly control the value of
      TLS Server Name Indication (RFC 3546) extension (Closes: #668041).
    - Added support for IP_FREEBIND socket option with a pached Linux kernel.
    - Glibc-specific dynamic allocation tuning was applied to help unused memory
      deallocation.
    - Non-blocking OCSP implementation.

  * Enabled hardening compile flags. There were NO compile time warning messages
    or errors triggered because of this.

  * Updated to Standards-Version 3.9.3. No changes required.
    - Migrating to /run from /var/run will be a hard problem, because we expect
      user written config files to refer to the directory. We'll punt on making
      this change for now.
  * Updated copyright years to 2012.
  * Added Description: LSB header to init script.

stunnel4 (3:4.50-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Releases. Highlights:
    + 4.46:
      - Added Unix socket support (e.g. "connect = /var/run/stunnel/socket").
      - Added "verify = 4" mode to ignore CA chain and only verify peer
        certificate.
      - Removed the limit of 16 IP addresses for a single 'connect' option.
      - Removed the limit of 256 stunnel.conf sections in PTHREAD threading
        model.
    + 4.45:
      - "protocol = proxy" support to send original client IP address to haproxy
         http://haproxy.1wt.eu/download/1.5/doc/proxy-protocol.txt
         This requires accept-proxy bind option of haproxy 1.5-dev3 or later.
      - Libwrap helper processes are no longer started if libwrap is disabled
        in all sections of the configuration file.
      - Fixed -l option handling in stunnel3 script (thx to Kai Gülzau).
      - Script to build default stunnel.pem was fixed (thx to Sebastian Kayser).
    + 4.44:
      - Heap buffer overflow protection with canaries.
      - Stack buffer overflow protection with -fstack-protector.
      - Fixed garbled error messages on errors with setuid/setgid options.
    + 4.43:
      - Major optimization of the logging subsystem.
        Benchmarks indicate up to 15% stunnel performance improvement.
  * Remove config.guess and config.sub in clean target, otherwise build fails
    because of changes in source outside of a patch. Found and fixed by
    Peter Eisentraut <petere@debian.org> (Closes: #647176).
  * Updated watchfile to new upstream's directory structure for archived
    releases.

stunnel4 (3:4.42-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Release.
   - Fixed a heap corruption vulnerability in versions 4.40 and 4.41.  It may
     possibly be leveraged to perform DoS or remote code execution attacks.
     (Closes: #638758)
   - New verify level 0 to request and ignore peer certificate.

 -- Luis Rodrigo Gallardo Cruz <rodrigo@debian.org>  Sat, 27 Aug 2011 08:34:43 -0700

     "ALL:!SSLv2:!aNULL:!EXP:!LOW:-MEDIUM:RC4:+HIGH".
   - Default ECDH curve updated to "prime256v1".
   - Removed support for temporary RSA keys (used in obsolete export ciphers).

stunnel4 (3:4.39-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Upstream Releases. Highlights:
   + 4.38:
     - Server-side SNI implemented (RFC 3546 section 3.1) with a new
       service-level option "nsi".
     - "socket" option also accepts "yes" and "no" for flags.
     - Nagle's algorithm is now disabled by default for improved interactivity.
     - Bugfix: Signal pipe set to non-blocking mode.  This bug caused
       hangs of stunnel features based on signals, e.g. local mode, FORK
       threading, or configuration file reload on Unix.  Win32 platform was
       not affected.
   + 4.37:
     - Client-side SNI implemented (RFC 3546 section 3.1).
     - Default "ciphers" changed from the OpenSSL default to a more secure
       and faster "RC4-MD5:HIGH:!aNULL:!SSLv2".
       A paranoid (and usually slower) setting would be "HIGH:!aNULL:!SSLv2".
     - Recommended "options = NO_SSLv2" added to the sample stunnel.conf file.
     - Default client method upgraded from SSLv3 to TLSv1.
       To connect servers without TLS support use "sslVersion = SSLv3" option.
     - Bugfix: Non-blocking socket handling in local mode fixed
       (Closes: #626856).
   + 4.36:
     - Dynamic memory management for strings manipulation:
       no more static STRLEN limit, lower stack footprint. (Closes: #594876).
     - Strict public key comparison added for "verify = 3" certificate
       checking mode (thx to Philipp Hartwig).
   For more details see upstream ChangeLog.

  * Removed /usr/lib/stunnel/libstunnel.la file.
  * Support restarting selected stunnel instances. Thanks Peter Palfrader.

  * New upstream version (Closes: #559270).
   - sessiond, a high performance SSL session cache was built for stunnel.
     A new service-level "sessiond" option was added.  sessiond is

stunnel4 (3:4.21-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release.
   - Binaries moved from /usr/sbin to /usr/bin. Thus, Debian no longer
    diverges in that from upstream.
   - libstunnel.so migrated inside /usr/lib/stunnel.
   - Preliminary FIPS 140-2 support, but this package does not include it,
    as it requires static compilation.
   - Miscelaneous bugfixing.
  * debian/patches/no_zlib_link:
   - Rebased. Only line numbering changed.
  * debian/patches/libstunnel_is_private_lib:
   - Removed. Included upstream.
  * debian/patches/fix-paths:
   - Remove hunks related to moving binaries to /usr/bin. Refresh line numbers
    in the rest.
  * debian/patches/rename-binary:
   - Rebased. Minor changes due to changed dates in the manpage and the use of
    @prefix@ in src/stunnel3.in.
  * debian/patches/setuid.patch:
   - Patch from upstream to allow using setuid/setgid with /etc/passwd and
    /etc/group not within chrooted directory.
  * debian/README.Debian:
   - Add explanation about not turning FIPS mode on.
   - Reword warning about binaries changing place.
  * debian/rules, debian/stunnel4.manpages:
   - No longer need to move the binaries.
   - Upstream location for manpages changed. We still install them by hand,
    anyways.
   - Ship fr and pl manpages.
   - Do not pass --host to configure if not cross compiling.
   - Reorder target dependencies. This should avoid problems when doing
    paralell builds.
  * debian/control:
   - Remove XS- prefix from Vcs-* fields.
   - Add Homepage: field.
   - Correct minor typo in dummy package's description.
   - Version build dependency on quilt, since we require 
    /usr/share/quilt/quilt.make (Closes: #447751).
   - Change my maintainer address.

stunnel4 (3:4.20-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/stunnel3.8:
    - Remove references to unsupported -S and -V options in manpage, and
    include an explicit list of tunable parameters for -O and their
    default values (Closes: #440718).
    - Rewrite -P argument description. It must be a file to be created, or
    empty (Closes: #398012).

stunnel4 (3:4.20-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add missing names and dates of copyright attributions to
    debian/copyright. Update licencing blurb to mention the new FSF's
    postal address.
  * Restructure README.Debian into sections.
  * Remove /usr/share/lintian/overrides and /usr/sbin from
    debian/dirs. Explicitely create the first if needed to install an
    override file, and explicitely remove the later after moving the
    binaries, in debian/rules.
  * Move StunnelConf-0.1.pl into /usr/share/doc/stunnel4/contrib. Remove
    it from debian/docs and explicitely install it in dh_install call.
  * Patch configure (debian/patches/no_zlib_link) to avoid linking to
    zlib. This library is a dependency of openssl, but not of ours.
  * Rewrite changelog entries from previous version, adding mention of
    modified files.
  * Use make -C dir instead of cd dir; make constructs in debian/rules.
