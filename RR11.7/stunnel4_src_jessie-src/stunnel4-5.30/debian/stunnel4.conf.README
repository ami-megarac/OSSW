Stunnel 4 configuration files.

Files found under the /etc/stunnel directory that end with .conf are
used by the stunnel4 service as configuration files, and each will be
used to start a daemon process setting up a tunnel with the given
configuration. Note that this directory is initially empty, as the
settings you may want for your tunnels are completely system dependent.

In order to have the tunnels start up automatically on system boot you
must *also* set ENABLED to 1 in /etc/default/stunnel4

A sample configuration file with defaults may be found at
 /usr/share/doc/stunnel4/examples/stunnel.conf-sample
